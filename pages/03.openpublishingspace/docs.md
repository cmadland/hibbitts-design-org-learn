[Grav Open Publishing Space Space](https://github.com/hibbitts-design/grav-skeleton-open-publishing-space) with [Git Sync](https://github.com/trilbymedia/grav-plugin-git-sync) is designed to help tech-savvy publishers publish, share collaboratively edit Markdown-based content.

One or more Open Publishing Space pages can also be embedded into another system (i.e. LMS) with the 'Chromeless Pages' option, which hides global navigation elements.

Explore a sample Open Publishing Space site at [demo.hibbittsdesign.org/open-publishing-space](http://demo.hibbittsdesign.org/grav-open-publishing/) and a 'Chromeless' sample site at [demo.hibbittsdesign.org/grav-skeleton-open-publishing-chromeless-site](http://demo.hibbittsdesign.org/grav-skeleton-open-publishing-chromeless-site/)

This is a brand new project (in-progress) and will be available for download at [Grav](http://getgrav.org) soon!
