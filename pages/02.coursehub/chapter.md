# Open Course Hub

[Grav Open Course Hub](https://github.com/hibbitts-design/grav-skeleton-course-hub) with [Git Sync](https://github.com/trilbymedia/grav-plugin-git-sync) is designed to give tech-savvy instructors an open, collaborative and flexible platform that they can partner with their current Learning Management System (LMS).  

One or more Open Course Hub pages can also be seamlessly embedded into another system (i.e. LMS) with the 'chromeless' feature of the Open Course Hub, see how in [Canvas](/coursehub/integrating-grav-with-canvas-lms) and [Moodle](/coursehub/integrating-grav-with-moodle).

Explore a [Open Course Hub site](http://demo.hibbittsdesign.org/grav-course-hub/) or a [Canvas LMS site](https://canvas.sfu.ca/courses/36662) with the same content embedded using the 'chromeless' feature.
