# Open Course Hub

[Grav Open Course Hub](https://github.com/hibbitts-design/grav-skeleton-course-hub) with [Git Sync](https://github.com/trilbymedia/grav-plugin-git-sync) is designed to give tech-savvy instructors an open, collaborative and flexible platform that they can partner with their current Learning Management System (LMS).  

One or more Open Course Hub pages can also be embedded into another system (i.e. LMS) with the ['Chromeless Pages' option](../coursehub/install-configure-video#making-the-open-course-hub-chromeless-eg-for-embedding-pages-int), which hides global navigation elements.
